                        but i do know  that you are gorgeous and you look like youre fun to be around. I only got to see you once in person and i must say i was blown away!! <br>
                        i know you probably hear that from alot of guys...but <br>
                        IM DIFFERENT

                        This probably forward of me to say so early but im just going to be blunt about it <br>
                        I want us to share something special...and not  in a friendly way thou, just to be clear <br>
                        i dont wanna be your friend...ultimately...

                        i want us to start off as friends maybe and see if we can grow to building a deeper connection <br>
                        honestly i dont have a real reason why "you" specifically... <br>
                        i just got  attracted to you in ways i cannot explain...

                        i want you to be the person i think about when i open my eyes first thing in the morning <br>
                        i want you to be the person i think of before sleep claims me late at night <br>
                        and  me to be the person you have  on your mind at those times <br>
                        my intentions are not to hurt or bring you pain but rather give you love in a way you have never experienced before
